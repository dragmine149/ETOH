      This site is a way to track tower progress for the roblox game <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Eternal-Towers-of-Hell">Eternal Towers of Hell</a>
      Made to surpass and improve upon https://jtoh.info/. A site for the same purpose.

      This site works all in the browser with no external requests, other than to roblox to grap the badge data.

      Although technically, you can view all this data in-game (with even more data!). This is an external view made to be accessible when not in-game for those short periods you need to check something.

        Some things you might not know / find out on your own about this website.
        - Clicking the username in the top right will actually let you enter in a different user instead and load them without having to go home.
        - The website uses the search parameters to load users from the url bar, hence saving time.
        - All user data is stored locally (untiil the storage fills up). This allows for offline viewing (of last download) and quicker loading times.
