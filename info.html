      This site is a way to track tower progress for the roblox game <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Eternal-Towers-of-Hell">Eternal Towers of Hell</a>
      Made to surpass and improve upon https://jtoh.info/. A site for the same purpose.

      This site works all in the browser with no external requests, other than to roblox to grap the badge data.

      Although technically, you can view all this data in-game (with even more data!). This is an external view made to be accessible when not in-game for those short periods you need to check something.
